# Description
Fridge to Table allows you to search recipes based on ingredients you already
have available in your refrigerator or pantry. This application will use the
[Edamam API] (https://developer.edamam.com/) and is being developed as
part of my first quarter (Q1) project for the Web Development Immersive program
at Galvanize.

## About Me
I am a Web Development student at Galvanize in Denver. After 9 years working
as an event and conference organizer, I decided to take my career
in a more creative direction, which led me to develop an interest in learning to
code and build responsive web apps.
