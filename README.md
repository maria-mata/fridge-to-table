# Description
Fridge to Table allows you to search recipes based on specific ingredients,
helping you make the most of what you have on hand. This application will use the
Edamam API (https://developer.edamam.com/) and is being developed as
part of my first quarter (Q1) project for the Web Development Immersive program
at Galvanize.

## About Me
I am a Web Development student at Galvanize in Denver. After 9 years working
as an event and conference organizer, I decided to take my career
in a more creative direction, which led me to develop an interest in learning to
code and build responsive web apps.
